      "description": "The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X is an 8-core desktop processor with Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT), which allows it to process 16 threads simultaneously. With its launch on 08.10.2020, it is the fastest 8-core processor from AMD.The Ryzen 7 5800X clocks with a base clock of 3.8 GHz and reaches up to 4.7 GHz on one core in turbo mode. When all 8 cores are utilized, the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X achieves up to 4.5 GHz.The performance of AMD Ryzen 7 5800X is consistently very good in all applications. Especially in multi-threaded applications, the native 8-core can show its strengths, although the single-core performance has been significantly improved compared to the older Zen 2 architecture.The internal structure of the processor has not changed fundamentally. The CCX structure has changed somewhat compared to Zen2, because now a CCX consists of up to 8-CPU cores. So, each individual core can access the complete L3 cache (32 MB). Furthermore, the CCX modules are connected to each other via the same I/O die, which we already know from Zen2. According to AMD, the Infinity-Fabric should now reach clock rates of up to 2Ghz, which in turn allows a RAM clock of 4.000 MHz without performance loss.For the manufacturing processes, AMD also relies on TSCM for the Vermeer processors for the 7nm production of the CPU cores, although the I/O die is still supplied in 12nm by GlobalFoundries.In games, AMD's Ryzen 7 5800X can convince with its significantly improved IPC and even put Intel in its place. With the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, gamers are well prepared for the future as simultaneous streaming is no problem with the new Ryzen 7 5800X.",

It can provide users the most comprehensive features and the fastest and smoothest Internet experience. HDMI 2.1, which is backward compatible with HDMI 2.0/ 1.4 and offering 48 Gb/s of bandwidth â€“ twice times more than the previous generation. This unlocks the potential for users to transfer multiple video streams, as well as a native cinematic 21:9 ratio (which most movies are shot in), Full HDR, and HDCP 2.3 support, to offer the best visual experience for viewers. With Smart Fan, 5 users can ensure that their gaming PC can maintain its performance while staying cool. Smart Fan 5 allows users to interchange their fan headers to reflect different thermal sensors at different locations on the motherboard. Not only that, with Smart Fan, but 5 more hybrid fan headers that support both PWM and Voltage mode fans have also been introduced to make the motherboard more liquid cooling friendly. Achieve fan silence. With Fan Stop, map any fan to stop completely when temperatures drop below a specified threshold. Which fan stops, based on readings from which sensor, and at what temperatureâ€”all of it can be customized to your liking. With B550 Motherboards, RGB Fusion 2.0 is even better with Addressable LEDs. RGB Fusion 2.0 offers users the option to control onboard RGB and external RGB / Addressable LED light strips* for their PC build. Already feature filled with colors and patterns, RGB Fusion 2.0 is now upgraded to improve the Addressable LED support. With external Addressable LED strips, where each LED is digitally addressable that users can experience even more patterns, styles, and illuminations. With B550 Motherboards support the external 5V Addressable LED lighting strips and up to 300 LED lights. RGB Fusion 2.0 with Addressable LEDs comes with new patterns and various speed settings with more to come. With an integrated intuitive user interface, the RGB Fusion 2.0 provides you a better solution for customizing the lighting effects across all supported devices. From motherboards, graphics cards to the peripheral products, you can personalize your gaming rig with your own style and show off your build by sharing the profiles. In addition, the new gaming mode makes the lighting effects interactive with selected games to bring you the most immersive gaming experience. GIGABYTE motherboards use high-end audio capacitors. These high-quality capacitors help deliver high resolution and high fidelity audio to provide the most realistic sound effects for gamers. GIGABYTE motherboards feature an audio noise guard that essentially separates the boardâ€™s sensitive analog audio components from potential noise pollution at the PCB level. With GIGABYTE Q-Flash Plus, you donâ€™t need to install the CPU, memory, and graphics card nor enter the BIOS menu to flash the BIOS. Just download and save a new BIOS file (rename to gigabyte.bin) on the USB flash drive, then press the dedicated Q-Flash Plus button and youâ€™re good to go! Sulfur compounds in the air can penetrate tiny onboard resistors creating chemical change and causing these resistors to open or short. If either of these occurs the motherboard will fail to function. By equipping resistors with an Anti-Sulfur Design GIGABYTE gives Ultra Durable Motherboards a whole new meaning. The BIOS is essential for users during the initial setup to allow for the most optimal settings. With a new GUI and easier to use functionalities, GIGABYTE has been able to reinvent the BIOS to give users a better experience while setting up their new system.",
